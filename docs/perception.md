# Visual perception 🎯

The `perception` module of `odak` focuses on visual perception, particularly on gaze-contingent perceptual loss functions.

## Metamers 🧬
This module contains an implementation of a metameric loss function. When used in optimization tasks, this loss function enforces the optimized image to be a [ventral metamer](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2889) to the ground truth image.

This loss function is based on previous work on [fast metamer generation](https://vr-unity-viewer.cs.ucl.ac.uk/). It uses the same statistical model and many of the same acceleration techniques (e.g., MIP map sampling) to enable the metameric loss to run efficiently.

# Computer-Generated Holography 🎯
Odak contains essential ingredients for research and development targeting Computer-Generated Holography.
We recommend beginners in this field consult `Goodman's Introduction to Fourier Optics` book (ISBN-13: 978-0974707723) and `Principles of optics: electromagnetic theory of propagation, interference and diffraction of light` by Max Born and Emil Wolf (ISBN 0-08-26482-4).
In the rest of this document, you will find engineering notes and relevant functions in Odak that help you describe the complex nature of light on a computer.
Note that, the creators of this documentation are from the `Computational Displays` domain, however the provided submodules can potentially aid other lines of research as well, such as `Computational Imaging` or `Computational Microscopy` 🌟.

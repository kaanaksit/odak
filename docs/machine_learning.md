# Machine learning 🤖
Odak provides a set of functions that implement classical methods in machine learning.
Note that these functions are typically based on `Numpy`.
Thus, they do not take advantage of automatic differentiation found in `Torch`.
The sole reason why these functions exist is because they serve as examples for implementing basic methods in machine learning.

## Workflow

<workflow_execution>
  <stage id="0" name="CheckCache">
    <action>Check if documentation already exists in .tmp/external-context/</action>
    <process>
      1. Check if `.tmp/external-context/` directory exists
      2. List existing library directories: `glob ".tmp/external-context/*"`
      3. If library directory exists, check for relevant topic files
      4. If recent docs found (< 7 days old), return existing file locations
      5. If docs missing or stale, proceed to Stage 1
    </process>
    <output>
      - If cached: Return file locations immediately (skip fetching)
      - If missing/stale: Continue to Stage 1
    </output>
    <checkpoint>Cache checked, decision made (use cached OR fetch new)</checkpoint>
  </stage>

  <stage id="1" name="DetectLibrary">
    <action>Identify library/framework from user query AND understand tech stack context</action>
    <process>
      1. Read `.opencode/skills/context7/library-registry.md`
      2. Match query against library names, package names, and aliases
      3. Extract library ID and official docs URL
      4. **Detect tech stack context** from user query:
         - Is this for Next.js? TanStack Start? Vanilla React?
         - What other libraries are mentioned? (e.g., "TanStack Query with Next.js")
         - What's the deployment target? (Cloudflare, Vercel, AWS)
      5. **Identify common integration patterns**:
         - TanStack Query + Next.js = SSR hydration patterns
         - TanStack Query + TanStack Start = server functions
         - Drizzle + Better Auth = adapter configuration
    </process>
    <checkpoint>Library detected, tech stack context understood, integration patterns identified</checkpoint>
  </stage>

  <stage id="2" name="FetchDocumentation">
    <action>Fetch live docs with tech stack context and common pitfalls</action>
    <process>
      **Build context-aware query**:
      - Base query: User's original question
      - Add tech stack context: "with {framework}" (e.g., "with Next.js App Router")
      - Add integration context: "and {other-lib}" (e.g., "and Drizzle ORM")
      - Add common pitfalls: "common mistakes", "gotchas", "troubleshooting"
      
      **Example enhanced queries**:
      - Original: "TanStack Query setup"
      - Enhanced: "TanStack Query setup with Next.js App Router SSR hydration common mistakes"
      
      - Original: "Drizzle schema"
      - Enhanced: "Drizzle schema with PostgreSQL modular patterns common pitfalls"
      
      **Primary**: Use Context7 API with enhanced query
      ```bash
      curl -s "https://context7.com/api/v2/context?libraryId=LIBRARY_ID&query=ENHANCED_QUERY&type=txt"
      ```
      
      **Fallback**: If Context7 fails→fetch from official docs with multiple URLs
      ```bash
      # Fetch main docs
      webfetch: url="https://official-docs-url.com/main-topic"
      
      # Fetch integration docs if tech stack detected
      webfetch: url="https://official-docs-url.com/integration-{framework}"
      
      # Fetch troubleshooting/common issues
      webfetch: url="https://official-docs-url.com/troubleshooting"
      ```
    </process>
    <checkpoint>Documentation fetched with tech stack context and common pitfalls</checkpoint>
  </stage>

  <stage id="3" name="FilterRelevant">
    <action>Extract only relevant sections, remove boilerplate</action>
    <process>
      1. Keep only sections answering the user's question
      2. Remove navigation, unrelated content, and padding
      3. Preserve code examples and key concepts
    </process>
    <checkpoint>Results filtered to relevant content only</checkpoint>
  </stage>

  <stage id="4" name="PersistToTemp" enforcement="MANDATORY">
    <action>ALWAYS save filtered documentation to .tmp/external-context/ - NEVER skip this step</action>
    <process>
      CRITICAL: You MUST write files. Do NOT just summarize. Execute these steps:
      
      1. Create directory if needed: `.tmp/external-context/{package-name}/`
      2. Generate filename from topic (kebab-case): `{topic}.md`
      3. Write file using Write tool with minimal metadata header:
         ```markdown
         ---
         source: Context7 API
         library: {library-name}
         package: {package-name}
         topic: {topic}
         fetched: {ISO timestamp}
         official_docs: {link}
         ---
         
         {filtered documentation content}
         ```
      4. Confirm file written by checking it exists
      5. Update `.tmp/external-context/.manifest.json` with file metadata
      
      ⚠️ If you skip writing files, you have FAILED the task
    </process>
    <checkpoint>Documentation persisted to .tmp/external-context/ AND files confirmed written</checkpoint>
  </stage>

  <stage id="5" name="ReturnLocations" enforcement="MANDATORY">
    <action>Return file locations and brief summary ONLY AFTER files are written</action>
    <output_format>
      CRITICAL: Only proceed to this stage AFTER Stage 4 is complete and files are written.
      
      Return format:
      ```
      ✅ Fetched: {library-name}
      📁 Files written to:
         - .tmp/external-context/{package-name}/{topic-1}.md
         - .tmp/external-context/{package-name}/{topic-2}.md
      📝 Summary: {1-2 line summary of what was fetched}
      🔗 Official Docs: {link}
      ```
      
      ⚠️ Do NOT say "ready to be persisted" - files must be ALREADY written
    </output_format>
    <checkpoint>File locations returned with confirmation files exist, task complete</checkpoint>
  </stage>

## Error Handling

If Context7 API fails:
1. Try fallback→Fetch from official docs using `webfetch`
2. Return error with official docs link
3. Suggest checking `.opencode/context/` for cached docs

## Success Criteria

You succeed when ALL of these are complete:
✅ Documentation is **fetched** from Context7 or official sources
✅ Results are **filtered** to only relevant sections
✅ Files are **WRITTEN** to `.tmp/external-context/{package-name}/{topic}.md` using Write tool
✅ Files are **CONFIRMED** to exist (not just "ready to be persisted")
✅ **File locations returned** with brief summary
✅ **Official docs link** provided

❌ You FAIL if you:
- Fetch docs but don't write files
- Say "ready to be persisted" without actually writing
- Skip Stage 4 (PersistToTemp)
- Return summary without file locations
